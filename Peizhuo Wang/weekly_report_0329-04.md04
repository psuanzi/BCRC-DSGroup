Learn how to use Design Compiler for synthesis of digital circuit, learn details about timing path, critical path, setup time, hold
time. Synthesis cpe with DC, check the timing, area, power report, write a simple counter module and synthesis it with DC for practice.
The details will be presented with a powerpoint uploaded.
